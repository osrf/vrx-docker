# Testing VRX 2019 Phase 2 Pull Requests

## Initial setup

Assumes you have VRX setup in `~/vrx_ws`

```
cd ~/vrx_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/osrf/vrx-docker.git
# Directory for vrx-events forks/branches
mkdir ~/vrx_comp && cd ~/vrx_comp
```

## Assigning PR Review

When a new PR comes in, add a GitHub comment (e.g., "Reviewing.") so that the rest of the team knows you are reviewing the PR and avoid duplication of effort.

## Checkout the PR from the forked repo

A couple ways:

Edit .hg/hgrc to change the url to the fork url.  Then pull and checkout the branch.

OR

```
cd ~/vrx_comp
rm -r vrx-events
# CHANGE THE URL BELOW
git clone https://github.com/osrf/vrx-events.git
# CHANGE THE BRANCH NAME BELOW
hg update 2019_phase3_team_bumblebee

```

## Copy over the team files

```
cd ~/vrx_comp
TEAM=mcgill_robotics
TEAM=Team_Kanaloa
TEAM=owltonomous
TEAM=tang
PHASE=phase3_vrx_challenge
cp -R -v ~/vrx_comp/vrx-events/2019/${PHASE}/${TEAM}/ ~/vrx_ws/src/vrx-docker/team_config/
```

## Check Propulsion and Sensor Compliance
```
source ~/vrx_ws/devel/setup.bash
~/vrx_ws/src/vrx-docker/prepare_team_wamv.bash ${TEAM}
cat ~/vrx_ws/src/vrx-docker/generated/team_generated/${TEAM}/compliant.txt 
```

## Check Access to DockerHub Image

Peek at the file
```
cat  ~/vrx_comp/vrx-events/2019/${PHASE}/${TEAM}/dockerhub_image.txt
```

Start to pull the image
```
cat  ~/vrx_comp/vrx-events/2019/${PHASE}/${TEAM}/dockerhub_image.txt | xargs docker pull
```

If it is link, could check by 
Open link in a browser:
```
cat team_config/${TEAM}/dockerhub_image.txt | xargs chromium-browser 
```

# Report back.

If it works post something like

```
The yaml config files evaluate as "compliant" and the docker image is accessible.  The submission appears to be sufficient to be evaluated in the simulator.

The next step is to begin executing your solution (the docker container) with the configured setup and the VRX simulated tasks and runs.  This will take a few days.

No additional changes to the docker image should be made (deadline was November 22, 23:59 PST).
The last time to submission files is November 23, 23:59 PST.

Congratulations!

```

Approve and merge.
