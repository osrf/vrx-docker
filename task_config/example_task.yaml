            #NOTE: if a macro is excluded in a sequence-override on an axis, it will also be excluded from world files of that coordinate of that axis
            #ie: worlds with the 'tasks' coordinate == 0 will NOT have the light_buoy macro, the ONLY macros contributed by this axis for 'tasks'  0, will be nav_challenge

#That is it, so now we will have 10 world xcaros and subsiquent world files.
#ALL of them will have the sandisland macro
#They will test the nav_challenge at 5 times of the day
#They will test the light_buoy at 5 times of a day
